# Online-Shoppers-Purchasing-Intention-


This project uses the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset from the UCI repository to explore customer behavior patterns. After performing exploratory data analysis and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features, the dataset is split into training and test sets. The K-means clustering algorithm is then applied to identify meaningful customer segments. The optimal number of clusters is determined using methods like the elbow method and silhouette score, and the clusters are visualized through scatter plots to better understand patterns in online shopping intentions.
